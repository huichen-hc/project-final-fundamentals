          I’m a frontend developer by day and a fearless mushroom hunter by weekend. If I’m not fixing bugs in my
            code, I’m probably avoiding bugs in the forest.
            I proudly hold the title of Duolingo Streak Queen (1370 days and counting) and have dabbled as an intern
            journalist and freelance writer in my “former life".
